# paper-football
Paper football game writen around 2003 in C using the Borland C++ 3.1 editor and some VGA graphics driver.

Execute the FOTBAL1.EXE file using DOSBox (https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/) after you mount your drive inside DOS ( 'mount C C:/').

Inside the game:

- the payers take turns to 'move' the ball.
- you move the ball using numberpad keys 1.2.3.4.6.7.8.9 for the corresponding direction.

Text is writtten in Romanian, I am accepting translations :)

And if you are able to compile it, let me know!
